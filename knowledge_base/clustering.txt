Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique that groups similar data points together based on their features. The goal is to find inherent structures in the data without using labeled outputs. Points within the same cluster should be similar to each other and different from points in other clusters. Common clustering algorithms include K-means, hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN, and Gaussian mixture models.
