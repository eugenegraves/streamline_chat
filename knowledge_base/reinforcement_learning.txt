Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize cumulative rewards. Unlike supervised learning, the agent isn't told which actions to take but must discover which actions yield the highest reward through trial and error. Key concepts include the agent, environment, states, actions, and rewards.
