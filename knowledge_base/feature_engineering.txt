Feature engineering is the process of selecting, transforming, and creating features (input variables) to improve machine learning model performance. Good feature engineering requires domain knowledge and data understanding. Techniques include scaling (normalization/standardization), encoding categorical variables, handling missing values, dimension reduction, and creating interaction terms.
